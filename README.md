Sharing a server TCP connection between multiple clients

## Introduction

This tool allows multiple TCP clients to share a single TCP connection to 
a server. Traffic generated by the server is forwarded to all clients. Traffic
generated from any client is forwarded to the server.

How is it useful? In many cases, we want to write program to automate tasks
with a remote service, but at the same time want to keep using the existing
tool that doesn't offer the functionality that your automation program is
capable of, but provides an easy/familiar UI, so that your automation program 
won't have to.

Here's a demonstration of it in action. As an example, in this case, there're
two MUD clients sharing the same connection to the server. Imagine one of the
two clients is a thin program that automates your player, but provides no
ability for human intervention. And the other client is a regular feature-rich
MUD client that you can interact with.
